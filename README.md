# QHost Bot

Qhost Bot is a Discord bot written for a community around the game [The Isle](https://store.steampowered.com/app/376210/The_Isle/) The bot manages user currency and acts as an administration system for staff to edit player files without ever connecting to the server. The bot will also automatically update files on the server when players purchase things with the currency. It was designed to be very small but with many feature requests the codebase grew to a massive size and is now depreciated as when I wrote most of it I was still learning the [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) framework. The bot can connect to a remote server via FTP but not all of the features will work.

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install TheIsle.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Replace your Discord bot token with the one currently used in main.py
